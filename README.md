##### Spectral Centroid
#### Dynamic Thresholding on Speech Segmentation
##### Thresholding using K-Means Clustering Algorithm
##### Thresholding using FCM Clustering Algorithm 
##### Spectrogram Feature and Otsuâ€™s Thresholding Method
##### Blocking Black Area Method

### SPEECH CLASSIFICATION
#### Syllable-based Speech Classification

### FEATURE EXTRACTION
#### Spectrogram Features
#### Short-Time Speech Features
#### MFCC Features
#### Binary Features

### SPEECH RECOGNITION USING NEURAL NETWORKS
Comparison study on some improved and faster BP algorithms:
#### BP with Momentum and Variable learning rate 
#### Resilient BP 
#### Conjugate gradient and 
#### Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

### IMPLEMENTATION
Using Matlab Neural Network Toolbox 8.9.0 (R2020a)

### DATASET
100 (one hundred) Bangla sentences, recorded from 5 (five) speakers. There are 656 words in the 100 Bangla sentences. Thus, the speech database contains 500 (100x5) Bangla sentences with 3280 (656x5) words.
